# renderingEngine
A 3D rendering engine using OpenGL.

I'm attempting to make a rendering engine using the OpenGL API!

Boilerplate Features
--

- [x] 3D Projection and Camera Movement
- [x] Custom texture mapping
- [ ] Diffuse lighting
- [ ] Multiple Lights
- [ ] Geometry Shader
- [ ] Compute Shader


Planned Advanced Features
--

- [ ] .obj Loading using assimp libraries
- [ ] Multiple texture maps (e.g. spec, normal, diff) 
- [ ] Advanced materials; PBR (reflections, refractions, diffusion, translucency
- [ ] Volume rendering; fog, clouds, fur (probably through ray marching)
- [ ] Frame buffer trickery
- [ ] Cube maps

The final aim for the project is to flesh out a 3D scene using all the above rendering techniques.
